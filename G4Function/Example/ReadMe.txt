========================================================
Example XYZ file contains simulation data taken from
bulk argon MD simulation.
--------------------------------------------------------
In order to calculate this example you have to compile
programs dedicated for two platforms

1. Linux
   a) CPU calculation
      Execute ./G4CPU Points.xyz
   b) GPU calculation
      Execute ./G4GPU Points.xyz
OR
    a) ./RunCPU      
    b) ./RunGPU
